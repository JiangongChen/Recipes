# Recipes
What's your recipes next week? 

Have you ever had a hard time thinking about what to eat? This project aims to generate random recipes for you based on a list of recipes. 

The list of recipes needs to be stored in a .txt file. The code will automatically extract the list from the file and randomly choose a specific number of recipes for you.
